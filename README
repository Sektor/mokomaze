======================================================================

Mokomaze is the opensource implementation of the classic game where
you control a steel ball by tilting a wooden labyrinth. It is
written in C using SDL and adapted for Neo Freerunner.

Benefits:
 * controlled by accelerometer
 * simulates (by vibration) feedback from ball hits against the walls
 * high performance and low resource consumption
 * simple levelpack file format

Building and installation:
--------------------------
As usual:
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install
The program uses "LiberationMono-Regular.ttf" font
(from package "ttf-liberation") which is usually placed in directory
"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-liberation". This path is configurable
via FONTDIR parameter for ./configure. E.g.:
  $ ./configure FONTDIR=/some/directory
libsdl, libsdl-image, libsdl-ttf and libode are also needed for
compilation. There is also --enable-rgb-swap option for ./configure
that may help to avoid font color swapping (specific to various
libsdl builds) which is assumed to be yellow-orange, not blue.

For cross-compiling, first set up the environment to use your toolchain
and pass architecture name to ./configure. For example, to compile the
game for Neo Freerunner with Openmoko Toolchain execute
  $ . /usr/local/openmoko/arm/setup-env
then install needed development packages if you have not done it
earlier:
  $ opkg-target update #unnecessary
  $ opkg-target install libsdl-1.2-dev
  $ opkg-target install libsdl-image-1.2-dev
  $ opkg-target install libsdl-ttf-dev
Configure the project and compile it
  $ ./configure --host=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi --prefix=/usr \
  > --enable-rgb-swap FONTDIR=/usr/share/fonts/truetype
  $ make
To create .ipk file execute
  $ cd ..
  $ om-make-ipkg <mokomaze-src-dir> <control-file>
Now copy installation package to Freerunner or memory card and
install it by 'opkg install'.

Running:
--------
Click on Mokomaze logo on home screen or application menu or run it
from the terminal by typing
  $ mokomaze
Some parameters can also be passed to it:
    mokomaze [-i input_device_type] [-l level_number] [-c option]
    -i, --input
        It is used to determine input device type manually. Currently
        supported values is 'freerunner' (to use Freerunner's
        accelerometer) and 'keyboard'.
    -l, --level
        It specifies a level from which the game will be started.
        Levels are counted from 1.
    -c, --calibrate
        It is used to perform the accelerometer calibration
        ('auto' option) or to reset calibration data ('reset' option).
    Examples:
        mokomaze
        mokomaze -l 5
        mokomaze -i freerunner
        mokomaze -i keyboard -l 2
        mokomaze -c auto
        mokomaze -c reset

Playing:
--------
Control the ball by tilting your Freerunner. Reach the exit, marked by
Openmoko logo, avoiding other holes.

Levelpack file format:
------------------
Levelpack file written in json and have simple structure. There are some
game levels in the file. Each level consists of "boxes" (walls),
"holes" and "checkpoints". Boxes are specified by 2 points:
  (x1,y1) - top left point in current screen coordinate system 
            (Mokomaze does not change screen parameters)
  (x2,y2) - bottom right point
