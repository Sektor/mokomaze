======================================================================

Mokomaze is an open source implementation of the classic game where
you control a steel ball by tilting a wooden labyrinth. It is
written in C using SDL and adapted for Neo Freerunner.

Benefits:
 * controlled by accelerometer
 * simulates (by vibration) feedback from ball hits against the walls
 * high performance and low resource consumption
 * simple level pack file format

Running
-------
Click on Mokomaze logo on the home screen or application menu or run it
from the terminal by typing
  $ mokomaze
Some parameters can also be passed to it:
  mokomaze [-i <type>] [-v <type>] [-c <option>] [-l <int>] [-x <int>]
  [-y <int>] [--bpp=<int>] [-s <boolean>] [-f <mode>] [--help]
    -i, --input=<type>        input device type
                              ('dummy', 'keyboard' or 'joystick')
    -v, --vibro=<type>        vibro device type
                              ('dummy' or 'freerunner')
    -c, --calibration=<option> perform input device calibration
                              ('auto' option) or reset calibration data
                              ('reset' option)
    -l, --level=<int>         define level from which the game will be
                              started
    -x <int>                  set window width
    -y <int>                  set window height
    --bpp=<int>               set color depth (16 or 32 bits per pixel)
    -s, --scrolling=<boolean> scroll game window if the level does not
                              fit to it
    -f, --fullscreen=<mode>   set fullscreen mode
                              ('none', 'ingame' or 'always')
    --help                    print this help and exit

  Examples:
    mokomaze
    mokomaze -l 5
    mokomaze -i freerunner -v freerunner -x 480 -y 640 --bpp=16 -s false
    mokomaze -i keyboard -v dummy -x 0 -y 0 --bpp=0 -s true -f none
    mokomaze -c auto
    mokomaze -c reset

Playing
-------
Control the ball by tilting your Freerunner. Reach the exit, marked by
Openmoko logo, avoiding other holes.

Level pack file format
----------------------
Level pack file is written in JSON and has a simple structure. There are
several game levels in the file. Each level consists of "boxes" (walls),
"holes" and "checkpoints". Boxes are specified by 2 points:
  (x1,y1) - top left point in current screen coordinate system
            (Mokomaze does not change screen parameters)
  (x2,y2) - bottom right point

Graphic content
---------------
Menu icons are based on the KDE icon from the Oxygen theme. The logo of
Mokomaze was created under the impression of Neverball logo. Other
pictures are made by the author of the game.

No Warranty
-----------
Mokomaze comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. See the COPYING file for
details.
