======================================================================

Mokomaze is an open source implementation of the classic game where
you control a steel ball by tilting a wooden labyrinth. It is
written in C using SDL and adapted for Neo Freerunner.

Benefits:
 * controlled by accelerometer
 * simulates (by vibration) feedback from ball hits against the walls
 * high performance and low resource consumption
 * simple level pack file format

Running
-------
Click on Mokomaze logo on the home screen or application menu or run it
from the terminal by typing
  $ mokomaze
Some parameters can also be passed to it:
    mokomaze [-i input_device_type] [-l level_number] [-c option]
    -i, --input
        It is used to determine input device type manually. Currently
        supported values is 'freerunner' (to use Freerunner's
        accelerometer) and 'keyboard'.
    -l, --level
        Specifies a level from which the game will be started.
        Levels are counted from 1.
    -c, --calibrate
        Performs the accelerometer calibration ('auto' option)
        or resets the calibration data ('reset' option).
    Examples:
        mokomaze
        mokomaze -l 5
        mokomaze -i freerunner
        mokomaze -i keyboard -l 2
        mokomaze -c auto
        mokomaze -c reset

Playing
-------
Control the ball by tilting your Freerunner. Reach the exit, marked by
Openmoko logo, avoiding other holes.

Level pack file format
----------------------
Level pack file is written in JSON and has a simple structure. There are
several game levels in the file. Each level consists of "boxes" (walls),
"holes" and "checkpoints". Boxes are specified by 2 points:
  (x1,y1) - top left point in current screen coordinate system
            (Mokomaze does not change screen parameters)
  (x2,y2) - bottom right point

Graphic content
---------------
All the pictures are made by the author of the game. Menu icons are
based on the KDE icon from the Oxygen theme. The logo of Mokomaze was
created under the impression of Neverball logo.

No Warranty
-----------
Mokomaze comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. See the COPYING file for
details.
